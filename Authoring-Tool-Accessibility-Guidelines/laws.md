Legislation is a strong expression of the political and societal awareness and will to implement accessibility as a fundamental human right. This chapter presents some basic information about web accessibility laws and their impact on everyday practice of web design, development, and usage. The explanations offered in this section are for informative purposes only and do not represent legal advice. Contact your organization's legal representative for official guidance around the legal landscape for accessibility.

Web accessibility laws tend to fit into the following categories:

**Civil rights laws**: These are laws that emphasize equal rights for people with disabilities, often making it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities under certain defined conditions, such as employment, access to buildings, government services, or "places of public accommodation" such as restaurants, retail, entertainment, etc. Sometimes these laws include technical standards. Other times they do not. The Americans with Disabilities Act is an example of a civil rights law.
**Procurement laws**: These laws require that accessibility be taken into account when making a purchase or when contracting for services. For example, the law could state that if there are three potential products and two of them meet accessibility standards, only the products that meet the standards should be considered for purchase. It would be against the law to buy the product that does not meet accessibility standards. The most prominent procurement laws (like Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act in the United States, and EN 301 549 in the European Union) apply only to government entities, but it is possible that a future law could impact private businesses.
**Industry-specific laws**: Sometimes an industry is so important to accessibility that the government writes a law just for that industry. Examples include telecommunications and airplane travel, both of which have accessibility-related laws in the United States, which are the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) and the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA), respectively.
